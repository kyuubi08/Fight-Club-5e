Each of the five must use its action and movement on three consecutive turns to perform an aerial dance and must maintain concentration while doing so (as if concentrating on a spell). When all five have finished their third turn of the dance, the elemental appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of them. It is friendly toward them and obeys their spoken commands. It remains for 1 hour, until it or all its summoners die, or until any of its summoners dismisses it as a bonus action. A summoner can't perform the dance again until it finishes a short rest. When the elemental returns to the Elemental Plane of Air, any aarakocra within 5 feet of it can return with it.</text>

			<name>Innate Spellcasting</name>
			<text>The oblex's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 15). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>3/day each: charm person (as 5th-level spell), color spray, detect thoughts, hold person (as 3rd-level spell).</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Sulfurous Impersonation</name>
			<text>As a bonus action, the oblex can extrude a piece of itself that assumes the appearance of one Medium or smaller creature whose memories it has stolen. This simulacrum appears, feels, and sounds exactly like the creature it impersonates, though it smells faintly of sulfur. The oblex can impersonate 1d4 + 1 different creatures, each one tethered to its body by a strand of slime that can extend up to 120 feet away. For all practical purposes, the simulacrum is the oblex, meaning that the oblex occupies its space and the simulacrum's space simultaneously. The slimy tether is immune to damage, but it is severed if there is no opening at least 1 inch wide between the oblex's main body and the simulacrum. The simulacrum disappears if the tether is severed.</text>

			<attack>Pseudopod|7|1d6+4+2d4</attack>
		</action>
		<action>
			<name>Eat Memories</name>
			<text>The oblex targets one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 18 (4d8) psychic damage and become memory drained until it finishes a short or long rest or until it benefits from the greater restoration or heal spell. Constructs, oozes, plants, and undead succeed on the save automatically.</text>
			<text>	While memory drained, the target must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from any ability check or attack roll it makes. Each time the target is memory drained beyond the first, the die size increases by one: the d4 becomes a d6, the d6 becomes a d8, and so on until the die becomes a d20, at which point the target becomes unconscious for 1 hour. The effect then ends.</text>
			<text>	When an oblex causes a target to become memory drained, the oblex learns all the languages the target knows and gains all its proficiencies, except for any saving throw proficiencies.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>Unconscious:</text>
			<text>&#8226; An unconscious creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, can't move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>&#8226; The creature drops whatever it's holding and falls prone.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>&#8226; The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>&#8226; Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>&#8226; Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.</text>

			<text>When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.</text>
			<text>	A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.</text>

			<text>	</text>
			<text>&#8226; 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object </text>

			<name>Hag Eye (Coven Only)</name>
			<text>A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.</text>
			<text>	A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.</text>

			<text>The Ring of Winter has 12 charges and regains all its expended charges daily at dawn. While attuned to and wearing the ring, Artus can expend the necessary number of charges to activate one of the following properties:</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>&#8226; Artus can expend 1 charge and use the ring to lower the temperature in a 120-foot-radius sphere centered on a point he can see within 300 feet of him. The temperature in that area drops 20 degrees per minute, to a minimum of _30 degrees Fahrenheit. Frost and ice begin to form on surfaces once the temperature drops below 32 degrees. This effect is permanent unless Artus uses the ring to end the effect as an action, at which point the temperature in the area returns to normal at a rate of 10 degrees per minute.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>&#8226; Artus can cast one of the following spells from the ring (spell save DC 17) by expending the necessary number of charges: Bigby's hand (2 charges; the hand is made of ice, is immune to cold damage, and deals bludgeoning damage instead of force damage as a clenched fist), cone of cold (2 charges), flesh to ice (3 charges; as flesh to stone except that the target turns to solid ice with the density and durability of stone), ice storm (2 charges), Otiluke's otiluke's freezing sphere (3 charges), sleet storm (1 charge), spike growth (1 charge; the spikes are made of ice), or wall of ice (2 charges).</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>&#8226; Artus can expend the necessary number of charges and use the ring to create either an inanimate ice object (2 charges) or an animated ice creature (4 charges). The ice object can't have any moving parts, must be able to fit inside a 10-foot cube, and has the density and durability of metal or stone (Artus's choice). The ice creature must be modeled after a beast with a challenge rating of 2 or less. The ice creature has the same statistics as the beast it models, with the following changes: the creature is a construct with vulnerability to fire damage, immunity to cold and poison damage, and immunity to the following conditions: charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned. The ice creature obeys only its creator's commands. The ice object or creature appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of Artus. It melts into a pool of normal water after 24 hours or when it drops to 0 hit points. In extreme heat, it loses 5 (1d10) hit points per minute as it melts. Use the guidelines in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide to determine the hit points of an inanimate object if they become necessary.</text>

			<name>Antimagic Cone</name>
			<text>The astral dreadnought's opened eye creates an area of antimagic, as in the antimagic field spell, in a 150-foot cone.

			<name>Demiplanar Donjon</name>
			<text>Any creature or object that the astral dreadnought swallows is transported to a demiplane that can be entered by no other means except a wish spell or this creature's Donjon Visit ability. A creature can leave the demiplane only by using magic that enables planar travel, such as the plane shift spell. The demiplane resembles a stone cave roughly 1,000 feet in diameter with a ceiling 100 feet high. Like a stomach, it contains the remains of the dreadnought's past meals. The dreadnought can't be harmed from within the demiplane. If the dreadnought dies, the demiplane disappears, and everything inside it appears around the corpse. The demiplane is otherwise indestructible.</text>

			<name>Soul Feeding</name>
			<text>A barghest can feed on the corpse of a humanoid that it killed that has been dead for less than 10 minutes, devouring both flesh and soul in doing so. This feeding takes at least 1 minute, and it destroys the victim's body. The victim's soul is trapped in the barghest for 24 hours, after which time it is digested. If the barghest dies before the soul is digested, the soul is released.</text>
			<text>	While a humanoid's soul is trapped in a barghest, any form of revival that could work has only a 50 percent chance of doing so, freeing the soul from the barghest if it is successful. Once a creature's soul is digested, however, no mortal magic can return that humanoid to life.</text>

			<name>Petrifying Gaze</name>
			<text>If a creature starts its turn within 30 ft. of the basilisk and the two of them can see each other, the basilisk can force the creature to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw if the basilisk isn't incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature magically begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.</text>
			<text>	A creature that isn't surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can't see the basilisk until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If it looks at the basilisk in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.</text>

			<name>Antimagic Cone</name>
			<text>The beholder's central eye creates an area of antimagic, as in the antimagic field spell, in a 150-foot cone. At the start of each of its turns, the beholder decides which way the cone faces and whether the cone is active. The area works against the beholder's own eye rays.</text>

			<name>Eye Rays</name>
			<text>The beholder shoots three of the following magical eye rays at random (reroll duplicates), choosing one to three targets it can see within 120 ft. of it:</text>
			<text>	1. Charm Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the beholder for 1 hour, or until the beholder harms the creature.</text>
			<text>	2. Paralyzing Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>
			<text>	3. Fear Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>
			<text>	4. Slowing Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target's speed is halved for 1 minute. In addition, the creature can't take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>
			<text>	5. Enervation Ray. The targeted creature must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</text>
			<text>	6. Telekinetic Ray. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or the beholder moves it up to 30 ft. in any direction. It is restrained by the ray's telekinetic grip until the start of the beholder's next turn or until the beholder is incapacitated.</text>
			<text>	If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn't being worn or carried, it is moved up to 30 ft. in any direction. The beholder can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container.</text>
			<text>	7. Sleep Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep and remain unconscious for 1 minute. The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes an action to wake it. This ray has no effect on constructs and undead.</text>
			<text>	8. Petrification Ray. The targeted creature must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.</text>
			<text>	9. Disintegration Ray. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 45 (10d8) force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine gray dust.</text>
			<text>	If the target is a Large or smaller nonmagical object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated without a saving throw. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of magical force, this ray disintegrates a 10-foot cube of it.</text>
			<text>	10. Death Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) necrotic damage. The target dies if the ray reduces it to 0 hit points.</text>
			<text>	</text>

			<name>Graystaff Magic</name>
			<text>The hag carries a graystaff, a length of gray wood that is a focus for her inner power. She can ride the staff as if it were a broom of flying. While holding the staff, she can cast additional spells with her Innate Spellcasting trait (these spells are marked with an asterisk). If the staff is lost or destroyed, the hag must craft another, which takes a year and a day. Only a bheur hag can use a graystaff.</text>

			<name>Ice Walk</name>
			<text>The hag can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn&#8217;t cost her extra moment.</text>

		<trait>
			<name>Innate Spellcasting</name>
			<text>The hag&#8217;s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>At will: hold person,* ray of frost</text>

		<trait>
			<name>Hag Coven</name>
			<text>When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.</text>
			<text>	A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only)</name>
			<text>While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves: </text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>&#8226; 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness </text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>&#8226; 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object </text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>&#8226; 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt </text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>&#8226; 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph </text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>&#8226; 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying </text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>&#8226; 6th level (1 slot): eyebite</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>	For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12+the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4+the hag's Intelligence modifier.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Hag Eye (Coven Only)</name>
			<text>A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.</text>
			<text>	A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.</text>

			<text>The hag feasts on the corpse of one enemy within 5 feet of her that died within the past minute. Each creature of the hag&#8217;s choice that is within 60 feet of her and able to see her must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of her for 1 minute. While frightened in this way, a creature is incapacitated, can't understand what others say, can't read, and speaks only in gibberish; the DM controls the creature&#8217;s movement, which is erratic. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature&#8217;s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag&#8217;s Maddening Feast for the next 24 hours.</text>

Any flesh-and-blood creature in the cloud when it appears, or that enters it later, must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature can't be infected by these spores for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature is infected with a disease called the spores of Zuggtmoy and also gains a random form of indefinite madness (determined by rolling on the Madness of Zuggtmoy table in appendix D) that lasts until the creature is cured of the disease or dies. While infected in this way, the creature can't be reinfected, and it must be repeat the saving throw at the end of every 24 hours, ending the infection on a success. On a failure, the infected creature's body is slowly taken over by fungal growth, and after three such failed saves, the creature dies and is reanimated as a spore servant if it's a type of creature that can be (see the "Myconids" entry in the Monster Manual).</text>

			<text>A gnome artisan values an individualized clockwork more highly than a perfectly functioning one that copies too much from another creation. For that reason, even clockworks that fit established designs, such as those described here, are seldom identical.</text>
			<text>	A clockwork can be customized by adding one of the following enhancements and one potential malfunction to its stat block. You can select randomly or choose a pair of modifications that fit the temperament of the clockwork's builder.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>d10 &#8212; Enhancement:</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>1 &#8212; Camouflaged. The clockwork gains proficiency in Stealth if it doesn't already have it. While motionless, it is indistinguishable from a stopped machine.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>2 &#8212; Sensors. The range of the clockwork's darkvision becomes 120 feet, unless it is higher, and it gains proficiency in Perception if it doesn't already have it.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>3 &#8212; Improved Armor. The clockwork's AC increases by 2.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>4 &#8212; Increased Speed. The clockwork's speed increases by 10 feet.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>5 &#8212; Reinforced Construction. The clockwork has resistance to force, lightning, and thunder damage.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>6 &#8212; Self-Repairing. If the clockwork starts its turn with at least 1 hit point, it regains 5 hit points. If it takes lightning damage, this ability doesn't function at the start of its next turn.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>7 &#8212; Sturdy Frame. The clockwork's hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to its number of Hit Dice.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>8 &#8212; Suction. The clockwork gains a climbing speed of 30 feet.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>9 &#8212; Vocal Resonator. The clockwork gains the ability to speak rudimentary Common or Gnomish (creator's choice).</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>10 &#8212; Water Propulsion. The clockwork gains a swimming speed of 30 feet.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>Clockwork Malfunctions:</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>d10 &#8212; Malfunction</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>1 &#8212; Faulty Sensors. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is blinded until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>2 &#8212; Flawed Targeting. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork makes attack rolls with disadvantage until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>3 &#8212; Ground Fault. The clockwork has vulnerability to lightning damage.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>4 &#8212; Imprinting Loop. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork mistakes one creature it can see within 30 feet for its creator. The clockwork won't willingly harm that creature for 1 minute or until that creature attacks it or deals damage to it.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>5 &#8212; Leaking Lubricant. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork gains 1 level of exhaustion that it isn't immune to.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>6 &#8212; Limited Steering. The clockwork must move in a straight line. It can turn up to 90 degrees before moving and again at the midpoint of its movement. It can rotate freely if it doesn't use any of its speeds on its turn.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>7 &#8212; Overactive Sense of Self-Preservation. If the clockwork has half its hit points or fewer at the start of its turn in combat, roll a d6. If you roll a 1, it retreats from combat. If retreat isn't possible, it continues fighting.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>8 &#8212; Overheats. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is incapacitated until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>9 &#8212; Rusty Gears. The clockwork has disadvantage on initiative rolls, and its speed decreases by 10 feet.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>10 &#8212; Weak Armor. The clockwork isn't immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren't adamantine.</text>

On a successful save, the creature can't be infected by these spores for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature is infected with a disease called the spores of Zuggtmoy and also gains a random form of indefinite madness (determined by rolling on the Madness of Zuggtmoy table in appendix D) that lasts until the creature is cured of the disease or dies. While infected in this way, the creature can't be reinfected, and it must be repeat the saving throw at the end of every 24 hours, ending the infection on a success. On a failure, the infected creature's body is slowly taken over by fungal growth, and after three such failed saves, the creature dies and is reanimated as a spore servant if it's a type of creature that can be (see the "Myconids" entry in the Monster Manual).</text>

			<text>	Disguises.</text>
			<text>	Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the true polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.</text>
			<text>	Wishes.</text>
			<text>	The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.</text>
			<text>	To be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit.</text>

			<name>Negative Energy Cone</name>
			<text>The death tyrant's central eye emits an invisible, magical 150-foot cone of negative energy. At the start of each of its turns, the tyrant decides which way the cone faces and whether the cone is active.</text>
			<text>	Any creature in that area can't regain hit points. Any humanoid that dies there becomes a zombie under the tyrant's command. The dead humanoid retains its place in the initiative order and animates at the start of its next turn, provided that its body hasn't been completely destroyed.</text>

			<name>Eye Rays</name>
			<text>The death tyrant shoots three of the following magical eye rays at random (reroll duplicates), choosing one to three targets it can see within 120 ft. of it:</text>
			<text>	1. Charm Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the death tyrant for 1 hour, or until the death tyrant harms the creature.</text>
			<text>	2. Paralyzing Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>
			<text>	3. Fear Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>
			<text>	4. Slowing Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target's speed is halved for 1 minute. In addition, the creature can't take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>
			<text>	5. Enervation Ray. The targeted creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</text>
			<text>	6. Telekinetic Ray. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or the death tyrant moves it up to 30 ft. in any direction. It is restrained by the ray's telekinetic grip until the start of the death tyrant's next turn or until the death tyrant is incapacitated.</text>
			<text>	If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn't being worn or carried, it is moved up to 30 ft. in any direction. The death tyrant can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container.</text>
			<text>	7. Sleep Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep and remain unconscious for 1 minute. The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes an action to wake it. This ray has no effect on constructs and undead.</text>
			<text>	8. Petrification Ray. The targeted creature must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.</text>
			<text>	9. Disintegration Ray. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 45 (10d8) force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine gray dust.</text>
			<text>	If the target is a Large or smaller nonmagical object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated without a saving throw. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of magical force, this ray disintegrates a 10-foot cube of it.</text>
			<text>	10. Death Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) necrotic damage. The target dies if the ray reduces it to 0 hit points.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>Charmed:</text>
			<text>&#8226; A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>&#8226; The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.</text>
			<text>	</text>

			<text>&#8226; A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>&#8226; The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>Paralyzed:</text>
			<text>&#8226; A paralyzed creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, and can't move or speak.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>&#8226; The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>&#8226; Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>&#8226; Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>Petrified:</text>
			<text>&#8226; A petrified creature is transformed, along with any nonmagical object it is wearing or carrying, into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone). Its weight increases by a factor of ten, and it ceases aging.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>&#8226; The creature is incapacitated (meaning it can't take actions or reactions), can't move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>&#8226; Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>&#8226; The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>&#8226; The creature has resistance to all damage.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>&#8226; The creature is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>Restrained:</text>
			<text>&#8226; A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>&#8226; Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>&#8226; The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>Unconscious:</text>
			<text>&#8226; An unconscious creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, can't move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>&#8226; The creature drops whatever it's holding and falls prone.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>&#8226; The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>&#8226; Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>&#8226; Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.</text>

If it dies while imprisoned, the devourer regains 25 hit points, immediately recharges Soul Rend, and gains an additional action on its next turn. Additionally, at the start of its next turn, the devourer regurgitates the slain creature as a bonus action, and the creature becomes an undead.

			<text>	</text>
			<text>	Disguises.</text>
			<text>	Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the true polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.</text>
			<text>	Wishes.</text>
			<text>	The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.</text>
			<text>	To be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit.</text>

			<text>The doppelganger magically reads the surface thoughts of one creature within 60 ft. of it. The effect can penetrate barriers, but 3 ft. of wood or dirt, 2 ft. of stone, 2 inches of metal, or a thin sheet of lead blocks it. While the target is in range, the doppelganger can continue reading its thoughts, as long as the doppelganger's concentration isn't broken (as if concentrating on a spell). While reading the target's mind, the doppelganger has advantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, and Persuasion) checks against the target.</text>

			<name>Variant: Genie Powers</name>
			<text>Genies have a variety of magical capabilities, including spells. A few have even greater powers that allow them to alter their appearance or the nature of reality.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>	Disguises.</text>
			<text>	Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the true polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.</text>
			<text>	Wishes.</text>
			<text>	The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.</text>
			<text>	To be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit.</text>

			<text>Whenever the golem starts its turn with 40 hit points or fewer, roll a d6. On a 6, the golem goes berserk. On each of its turns while berserk, the golem attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, the golem attacks an object, with preference for an object smaller than itself. Once the golem goes berserk, it continues to do so until it is destroyed or regains all its hit points.</text>

The golem must be able to hear its creator, who must take an action to make a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If the check succeeds, the golem ceases being berserk. If it takes damage while still at 40 hit points or fewer, the golem might go berserk again.</text>

The ghost can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.</text>

When the possession ends, the ghost reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 ft. of the body. The target is immune to this ghost's Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.</text>

			<name>Hag Eye (Coven Only)</name>
			<text>A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item.

A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.</text>
			<text>	A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual.

			<name>Shapechanger</name>
			<text>The slaad can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid, or back into its true form. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Innate Spellcasting</name>
			<text>The slaad's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12). The slaad can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components: </text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>	At will: detect magic, detect thoughts, mage hand</text>
			<text>	2/day each: fear, invisibility (self only)</text>
			<text>	1/day: fireball</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Magic Resistance</name>
			<text>The slaad has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects</text>

			<text>The slaad regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Variant: Control Gem</name>
			<text>Implanted in the slaad's brain is a magic control gem. The slaad must obey whoever possesses the gem and is immune to being charmed while so controlled.</text>
			<text>	Certain spells can be used to acquire the gem. If the slaad fails its saving throw against imprisonment, the spell can transfer the gem to the spellcaster's open hand, instead of imprisoning the slaad. A wish spell, if cast in the slaad's presence, can be worded to acquire the gem.</text>
			<text>	A greater restoration spell cast on the slaad destroys the gem without harming the slaad.</text>
			<text>	Someone who is proficient in Wisdom (Medicine) can remove the gem from an incapacitated slaad. Each try requires 1 minute of uninterrupted work and a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Medicine) check. Each failed attempt deals 22 (4d10) psychic damage to the slaad.</text>

			<text>The hellfire engine moves up to its speed in a straight line. During this move, it can enter Large or smaller creatures' spaces. A creature whose space the hellfire engine enters must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is pushed 5 feet to the nearest space out of the hellfire engine's path. On a failed save, the creature falls prone and takes 28 (8d6) bludgeoning damage.</text>
			<text>	If the hellfire engine remains in the prone creature's space, the creature is also restrained until it's no longer in the same space as the hellfire engine. While restrained in this way, the creature, or another creature within 5 feet of it, can make a DC 18 Strength check. On a success, the creature is shunted to an unoccupied space of its choice within 5 feet of the hellfire engine and is no longer restrained.</text>

Whenever a creature finishes moving through the frigid air on a turn, willingly or otherwise, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

			<name>Wall of Ice</name>
			<text>The devil magically forms an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it can see within 60 feet of it. The wall is 1 foot thick and up to 30 feet long and 10 feet high, or it's a hemispherical dome up to 20 feet in diameter.</text>
			<text>	When the wall appears, each creature in its space is pushed out of it by the shortest route. The creature chooses which side of the wall to end up on, unless the creature is incapacitated. The creature then makes a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</text>
			<text>	The wall lasts for 1 minute or until the devil is incapacitated or dies. The wall can be damaged and breached; each 10-foot section has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. If a section is destroyed, it leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied. Whenever a creature finishes moving through the frigid air on a turn, willingly or otherwise, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The frigid air dissipates when the rest of the wall vanishes.</text>

		<legendary>
			<name>Heat Wave</name>
			<text>Imix creates a blast of heat within 300 feet of himself. Each creature in the area in physical contact with metal objects (for example, carrying metal weapons or wearing metal armor) takes 9 (2d8) fire damage. Each creature in the area that isn't resistant or immune to fire damage must make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>Exhaustion:</text>
			<text>	Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>Level &#8212; Effect:</text>
			<text>1 &#8212;Disadvantage on ability checks</text>
			<text>2 &#8212;Speed halved</text>
			<text>3 &#8212;Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws</text>
			<text>4 &#8212;Hit point maximum halved</text>
			<text>5 &#8212;Speed reduced to 0</text>
			<text>	6 &#8212;Death</text>
			<text></text>
			<text>If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.</text>
			<text>	A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.</text>
			<text>	An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.</text>
			<text>	Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.</text>

		<legendary>
			<name>Combustion (Costs 3 Actions)</name>
			<text>Imix causes one creature he can see within 30 feet of him to burst into flames. The target must make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 70 (20d6) fire damage and catches fire. A target on fire takes 10 (3d6) fire damage when it starts its turn, and remains on fire until it or another creature takes an action to douse the flames. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and doesn't catch fire.</text>

			<text>The intellect devourer initiates an Intelligence contest with an incapacitated humanoid within 5 feet of it that isn't protected by protection from evil and good. If it wins the contest, the intellect devourer magically consumes the target's brain, teleports into the target's skull, and takes control of the target's body. While inside a creature, the intellect devourer has total cover against attacks and other effects originating outside its host. The intellect devourer retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as its understanding of Deep Speech, its telepathy, and its traits. It otherwise adopts the target's statistics. It knows everything the creature knew, including spells and languages.</text>
			<text>	If the host body dies, the intellect devourer must leave it. A protection from evil and good spell cast on the body drives the intellect devourer out. The intellect devourer is also forced out if the target regains its devoured brain by means of a wish. By spending 5 feet of its movement, the intellect devourer can voluntarily leave the body, teleporting to the nearest unoccupied space within 5 feet of it. The body then dies, unless its brain is restored within 1 round.</text>

		<trait>
			<name>Individual Designs</name>
			<text>A gnome artisan values an individualized clockwork more highly than a perfectly functioning one that copies too much from another creation. For that reason, even clockworks that fit established designs, such as those described here, are seldom identical.</text>
			<text>	A clockwork can be customized by adding one of the following enhancements and one potential malfunction to its stat block. You can select randomly or choose a pair of modifications that fit the temperament of the clockwork's builder.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>d10 &#8212; Enhancement:</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>1 &#8212; Camouflaged. The clockwork gains proficiency in Stealth if it doesn't already have it. While motionless, it is indistinguishable from a stopped machine.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>2 &#8212; Sensors. The range of the clockwork's darkvision becomes 120 feet, unless it is higher, and it gains proficiency in Perception if it doesn't already have it.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>3 &#8212; Improved Armor. The clockwork's AC increases by 2.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>4 &#8212; Increased Speed. The clockwork's speed increases by 10 feet.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>5 &#8212; Reinforced Construction. The clockwork has resistance to force, lightning, and thunder damage.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>6 &#8212; Self-Repairing. If the clockwork starts its turn with at least 1 hit point, it regains 5 hit points. If it takes lightning damage, this ability doesn't function at the start of its next turn.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>7 &#8212; Sturdy Frame. The clockwork's hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to its number of Hit Dice.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>8 &#8212; Suction. The clockwork gains a climbing speed of 30 feet.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>9 &#8212; Vocal Resonator. The clockwork gains the ability to speak rudimentary Common or Gnomish (creator's choice).</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>10 &#8212; Water Propulsion. The clockwork gains a swimming speed of 30 feet.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>Clockwork Malfunctions:</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>d10 &#8212; Malfunction</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>1 &#8212; Faulty Sensors. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is blinded until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>2 &#8212; Flawed Targeting. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork makes attack rolls with disadvantage until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>3 &#8212; Ground Fault. The clockwork has vulnerability to lightning damage.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>4 &#8212; Imprinting Loop. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork mistakes one creature it can see within 30 feet for its creator. The clockwork won't willingly harm that creature for 1 minute or until that creature attacks it or deals damage to it.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>5 &#8212; Leaking Lubricant. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork gains 1 level of exhaustion that it isn't immune to.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>6 &#8212; Limited Steering. The clockwork must move in a straight line. It can turn up to 90 degrees before moving and again at the midpoint of its movement. It can rotate freely if it doesn't use any of its speeds on its turn.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>7 &#8212; Overactive Sense of Self-Preservation. If the clockwork has half its hit points or fewer at the start of its turn in combat, roll a d6. If you roll a 1, it retreats from combat. If retreat isn't possible, it continues fighting.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>8 &#8212; Overheats. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is incapacitated until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>9 &#8212; Rusty Gears. The clockwork has disadvantage on initiative rolls, and its speed decreases by 10 feet.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>10 &#8212; Weak Armor. The clockwork isn't immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren't adamantine.</text>

			<text>1. Poison Damage: The target takes 13 (3d8) poison damage.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>2. Confusion: On its next turn, the target must use its action to make one weapon attack against a random creature it can see within 30 feet of it, using whatever weapon it has in hand and moving beforehand if necessary to get in range. If it's holding no weapon, it makes an unarmed strike. If no creature is visible within 30 feet, it takes the Dash action, moving toward the nearest creature.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>3. Paralysis: The target is paralyzed until the end of its next turn.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>Paralyzed:</text>

			<text>The kobold uses one of the following options (roll a d8 or choose one); the kobold can use each one no more than once per day:</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>1. Acid. The kobold hurls a flask of acid. Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 5/20 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d6) acid damage.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>2. Alchemist&#8217;s fire. The kobold throws a flask of alchemist's fire. Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 5/20 ft., one target. Hit: 2 (1d4) fire damage at the start of each of the target&#8217;s turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>3. Basket of Centipedes. The kobold throws a small basket into a S-foot-square space within 20 feet of it. A swarm of insects (centipedes) with 11 hit points emerges from the basket and rolls initiative. At the end of each of the swarm&#8217;s turns, there's a 50 percent chance that the swarm disperses.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>4. Green Slime Pot. The kobold throws a clay pot full of green slime at the target, and it breaks open on impact. Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 5/20 ft., one target. Hit: The target is covered in a patch of green slime (see chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master&#8217;s Guide). Miss: A patch of green slime covers a randomly determined S-foot-square section of wall or floor within 5 feet of the target.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>5. Rot Grub Pot. The kobold throws a clay pot into a 5-foot-square space within 20 feet of it, and it breaks open on impact. A swarm of rot grubs (see appendix A) emerges from the shattered pot and remains a hazard in that square.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>6. Scorpion on a Stick. The kobold makes a melee attack with a scorpion tied to the end of a 5-foot-long pole. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1 piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 9 Constitution saving throw, taking 4 (1d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>7. Skunk in a Cage. The kobold releases a skunk into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of it. The skunk has a walking speed of 20 feet, AC 10, 1 hit point, and no effective attacks. It rolls initiative and, on its turn, uses its action to spray musk at a random creature within 5 feet of it. The target must make a DC 9 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target retches and can&#8217;t take actions for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that doesn&#8217;t need to breathe or is immune to poison automatically succeeds on the saving throw. Once the skunk has sprayed its musk, it can&#8217;t do so again until it finishes a short or long rest.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>8. Wasp Nest in a Bag. The kobold throws a small bag into a 5-foot-square space within 20 feet of it. A swarm of insects (wasps) with 11 hit points emerges from the bag and rolls initiative. At the end of each of the swarm's turns, there&#8217;s a 50 percent chance that the swarm disperses.</text>

			<text>	Disguises.</text>
			<text>	Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the true polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.</text>
			<text>	Wishes.</text>
			<text>	The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.</text>
			<text>	To be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit.</text>

			<text>When a creature that can see Marlos's eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of him, Marlos can force it to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw if Marlos isn't incapacitated and can see the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.</text>
			<text>	Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see Marlos until the start of its next turn, when it can decide to avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at Marlos in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.</text>

			<name>Petrifying Gaze</name>
			<text>When a creature that can see the medusa's eyes starts its turn within 30 ft. of the medusa, the medusa can force it to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw if the medusa isn't incapacitated and can see the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.</text>
			<text>	Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the medusa until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the medusa in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.</text>

			<text>Eye Rays. The mindwitness shoots three of the following magical eye rays at random (reroll duplicates), choosing one to three targets it can see within 120 feet of it:</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>1. Aversion Ray: The targeted creature must make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>
			<text>	 </text>

			<text>	 </text>
			<text>3. Psychic Ray: The target must succeed on a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw or take 27 (6d8) psychic damage.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>4. Slowing Ray: The targeted creature must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target&#8217;s speed is halved for 1 minute. In addition, the creature can&#8217;t take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn but not both. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>5. Stunning Ray: The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be stunned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>6. Telekinetic Ray: If the target is a creature, it must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the mindwitness moves it up to 30 feet in any direction, and it is restrained by the ray&#8217;s telekinetic grip until the start of the mindwitness&#8217;s next turn or until the mindwitness is incapacitated.</text>
			<text>	If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn't being worn or carried, it is telekinetically moved up to 30 feet in any direction. The mindwitness can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container.</text>

			<text>A nabassu can eat the soul of a creature it has killed within the last hour, provided that creature is neither a construct nor an undead. The devouring requires the nabassu to be within 5 feet of the corpse for at least 10 minutes, after which it gains a number of Hit Dice (d8s) equal to half the creature's number of Hit Dice. Roll those dice, and increase the nabassu's hit points by the numbers rolled. For every 4 Hit Dice the nabassu gains in this way, its attacks deal an extra 3 (1d6) damage on a hit.

			<name>Hag Eye (Coven Only)</name>
			<text>A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.</text>
			<text>	A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.</text>

			<text>The oaken bolter has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Individual Designs</name>
			<text>A gnome artisan values an individualized clockwork more highly than a perfectly functioning one that copies too much from another creation. For that reason, even clockworks that fit established designs, such as those described here, are seldom identical.</text>
			<text>	A clockwork can be customized by adding one of the following enhancements and one potential malfunction to its stat block. You can select randomly or choose a pair of modifications that fit the temperament of the clockwork's builder.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>d10 &#8212; Enhancement:</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>1 &#8212; Camouflaged. The clockwork gains proficiency in Stealth if it doesn't already have it. While motionless, it is indistinguishable from a stopped machine.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>2 &#8212; Sensors. The range of the clockwork's darkvision becomes 120 feet, unless it is higher, and it gains proficiency in Perception if it doesn't already have it.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>3 &#8212; Improved Armor. The clockwork's AC increases by 2.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>4 &#8212; Increased Speed. The clockwork's speed increases by 10 feet.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>5 &#8212; Reinforced Construction. The clockwork has resistance to force, lightning, and thunder damage.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>6 &#8212; Self-Repairing. If the clockwork starts its turn with at least 1 hit point, it regains 5 hit points. If it takes lightning damage, this ability doesn't function at the start of its next turn.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>7 &#8212; Sturdy Frame. The clockwork's hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to its number of Hit Dice.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>8 &#8212; Suction. The clockwork gains a climbing speed of 30 feet.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>9 &#8212; Vocal Resonator. The clockwork gains the ability to speak rudimentary Common or Gnomish (creator's choice).</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>10 &#8212; Water Propulsion. The clockwork gains a swimming speed of 30 feet.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>Clockwork Malfunctions:</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>d10 &#8212; Malfunction</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>1 &#8212; Faulty Sensors. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is blinded until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>2 &#8212; Flawed Targeting. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork makes attack rolls with disadvantage until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>3 &#8212; Ground Fault. The clockwork has vulnerability to lightning damage.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>4 &#8212; Imprinting Loop. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork mistakes one creature it can see within 30 feet for its creator. The clockwork won't willingly harm that creature for 1 minute or until that creature attacks it or deals damage to it.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>5 &#8212; Leaking Lubricant. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork gains 1 level of exhaustion that it isn't immune to.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>6 &#8212; Limited Steering. The clockwork must move in a straight line. It can turn up to 90 degrees before moving and again at the midpoint of its movement. It can rotate freely if it doesn't use any of its speeds on its turn.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>7 &#8212; Overactive Sense of Self-Preservation. If the clockwork has half its hit points or fewer at the start of its turn in combat, roll a d6. If you roll a 1, it retreats from combat. If retreat isn't possible, it continues fighting.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>8 &#8212; Overheats. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is incapacitated until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>9 &#8212; Rusty Gears. The clockwork has disadvantage on initiative rolls, and its speed decreases by 10 feet.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>10 &#8212; Weak Armor. The clockwork isn't immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren't adamantine.</text>

This reduction can be removed only by a wish spell or by casting greater restoration on the target three times within the same hour. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>Exhaustion:</text>
			<text>	Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion.

			<text>If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.</text>
			<text>	A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.</text>
			<text>	An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.</text>

If the wormling takes 10 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the wormling must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the wormling.

		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Horrific Appearance</name>
			<text>Any humanoid that starts its turn within 30 feet of the hag and can see the hag's true form must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the hag is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag's Horrific Appearance for the next 24 hours.</text>
			<text>	Unless the target is surprised or the revelation of the hag's true form is sudden, the target can avert its eyes and avoid making the initial saving throw. Until the start of its next turn, a creature that averts its eyes has disadvantage on attack rolls against the hag.</text>
			<text>	</text>

			<text>&#8226; A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.</text>

			<name>Hag Coven</name>
			<text>When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.</text>
			<text>	A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only)</name>
			<text>While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves: </text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>&#8226; 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness </text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>&#8226; 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object </text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>&#8226; 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt </text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>&#8226; 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph </text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>&#8226; 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying </text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>&#8226; 6th level (1 slot): eyebite</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>	For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12+the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4+the hag's Intelligence modifier.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Hag Eye (Coven Only)</name>
			<text>A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.</text>
			<text>	A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.</text>

			<name>Contamination</name>
			<text>The sibriex emits an aura of corruption 30 feet in every direction. Plants that aren't creatures wither in the aura, and the ground in it is difficult terrain for other creatures. Any creature that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or take 14 (4d6) poison damage.

		</action>
		<action>
			<name>Warp Creature</name>
			<text>The sibriex targets up to three creatures it can see within 120 feet of it. Each target must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, a creature becomes immune to this sibriex's Warp Creature. On a failed save, the target is poisoned, which causes it to also gain 1 level of exhaustion. While poisoned in this way, the target must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns. Three successful saves against the poison end it, and ending the poison removes any levels of exhaustion caused by it. Each failed save causes the target to suffer another level of exhaustion. Once the target reaches 6 levels of exhaustion, it dies and instantly transforms into a living abyssal wretch under the sibriex's control. The transformation of the body can be undone only by a wish spell.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>Exhaustion:</text>
			<text>	Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>Level &#8212; Effect:</text>
			<text>1 &#8212;Disadvantage on ability checks</text>
			<text>2 &#8212;Speed halved</text>
			<text>3 &#8212;Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws</text>
			<text>4 &#8212;Hit point maximum halved</text>
			<text>5 &#8212;Speed reduced to 0</text>
			<text>	6 &#8212;Death</text>
			<text></text>
			<text>If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.</text>
			<text>	A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.</text>
			<text>	An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.</text>
			<text>	Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>Poisoned:</text>
			<text>&#8226; A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</text>
		</action>
		<action>
			<name>Variant: Flesh Warping</name>
			<text>Creatures that encounter a sibriex can be twisted beyond recognition. Whenever a creature fails a saving throw against the sibriex's Warp Creature effect, you can roll percentile dice and consult the Flesh Warping table to determine an additional effect, which vanishes when Warp Creature ends on the creature. If the creature transforms into an abyssal wretch, the effect becomes a permanent feature of that body.</text>
			<text>	A creature can willingly submit to flesh warping, an agonizing process that takes at least 1 hour while the creature stays within 30 feet of the sibriex. At the end of the process, roll once on the table (or choose one effect) to determine how the creature is transformed permanently.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>d100 &#8212; Effect:</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>01&#8211;05 &#8212; The color of the target's hair, eyes, and skin becomes blue, red, yellow, or patterned.</text>
			<text>	 </text>

			<text>	 </text>
			<text>11&#8211;15 &#8212; The target's hands grow claws, which can be used as daggers.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>16&#8211;20 &#8212; One of the target's legs grows longer than the other, reducing its walking speed by 10 feet.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>21&#8211;25 &#8212; The target's eyes become beacons, filling a 15-foot cone with dim light when they are open.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>26&#8211;30 &#8212; A pair of wings, either feathered or leathery, sprout from the target's back, granting it a flying speed of 30 feet.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>31&#8211;35 &#8212; The target's ears tear free from its head and scurry away; the target is deafened.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>36&#8211;40 &#8212; Two of the target's teeth turn into tusks.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>41&#8211;45 &#8212; The target's skin becomes scabby, granting it a +1 bonus to AC but reducing its Charisma by 2 (to a minimum of 1).</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>46&#8211;50 &#8212; The target's arms and legs switch places, preventing the target from moving unless it crawls.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>51&#8211;55 &#8212; The target's arms become tentacles with fingers on the ends, increasing its reach by 5 feet.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>56&#8211;60 &#8212; The target's legs grow incredibly long and springy, increasing its walking speed by 10 feet.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>61&#8211;65 &#8212; The target grows a whiplike tail, which it can use as a whip.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>66&#8211;70 &#8212; The target's eyes turn black, and it gains darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>71&#8211;75 &#8212; The target swells, tripling its weight.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>76&#8211;80 &#8212; The target becomes thin and skeletal, halving its weight.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>81&#8211;85 &#8212; The target's head doubles in size.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>86&#8211;90 &#8212; The target's ears become wings, giving it a flying speed of 5 feet.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>91&#8211;95 &#8212; The target's body becomes unusually brittle, causing the target to have vulnerability to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>96&#8211;00 &#8212; The target grows another head, causing it to have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, frightened, or stunned.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>Deafened:</text>
			<text>&#8226; A deafened creature can't hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing. </text>

			<name>Wave of Weariness (Recharge 4-6)</name>
			<text>The soul monger emits weariness in a 60-foot cube. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 45 (10d8) psychic damage and suffers 1 level of exhaustion. On a successful save, it takes 22 (5d8) psychic damage.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>Exhaustion:</text>
			<text>	Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>Level &#8212; Effect:</text>
			<text>1 &#8212;Disadvantage on ability checks</text>
			<text>2 &#8212;Speed halved</text>
			<text>3 &#8212;Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws</text>

			<text>5 &#8212;Speed reduced to 0</text>
			<text>	6 &#8212;Death</text>
			<text></text>
			<text>If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.</text>
			<text>	A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.</text>
			<text>	An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.</text>
			<text>	Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.</text>

			<text>The spawn of Kyuss regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn&#8217;t in sunlight or a body of running water. If the spawn takes acid, fire, or radiant damage, this trait doesn&#8217;t function at the start of the spawn's next turn.

			<text>The spawn of Kyuss makes two attacks with its claws and uses Burrowing Worm.</text>

		<action>
			<name>Burrowing Worm</name>
			<text>A worm launches from the spawn of Kyuss at one humanoid that the spawn can see within 10 feet of it. The worm latches onto the target&#8217;s skin unless the target succeeds on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw. The worm is a Tiny undead with AC 6, 1 hit point, a 2 (-4) in every ability score, and a speed of 1 foot. While on the target&#8217;s skin, the worm can be killed by normal means or scraped off using an action (the spawn can use this action to launch a scraped-off worm at a humanoid it can see within 10 feet of the worm). Otherwise, the worm burrows under the target&#8217;s skin at the end of the target's next turn, dealing l piercing damage to it. At the end of each of its turns thereafter, the target takes 7 (2d6) necrotic damage per worm infesting it (maximum of 10d6). A worm-infested target dies if it drops to 0 hit points, then rises 10 minutes later as a spawn of Kyuss. If a worm-infested creature is targeted by an effect that cures disease or removes a curse, all the worms infesting it wither away.</text>

			<text>A clockwork doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</text>

			<name>False Appearance</name>
			<text>While the stone defender remains motionless against an uneven earthen or stone surface, it is indistinguishable from that surface.</text>

			<name>Magic Resistance</name>
			<text>The stone defender has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Individual Designs</name>
			<text>A gnome artisan values an individualized clockwork more highly than a perfectly functioning one that copies too much from another creation. For that reason, even clockworks that fit established designs, such as those described here, are seldom identical.</text>
			<text>	A clockwork can be customized by adding one of the following enhancements and one potential malfunction to its stat block. You can select randomly or choose a pair of modifications that fit the temperament of the clockwork's builder.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>d10 &#8212; Enhancement:</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>1 &#8212; Camouflaged. The clockwork gains proficiency in Stealth if it doesn't already have it. While motionless, it is indistinguishable from a stopped machine.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>2 &#8212; Sensors. The range of the clockwork's darkvision becomes 120 feet, unless it is higher, and it gains proficiency in Perception if it doesn't already have it.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>3 &#8212; Improved Armor. The clockwork's AC increases by 2.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>4 &#8212; Increased Speed. The clockwork's speed increases by 10 feet.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>5 &#8212; Reinforced Construction. The clockwork has resistance to force, lightning, and thunder damage.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>6 &#8212; Self-Repairing. If the clockwork starts its turn with at least 1 hit point, it regains 5 hit points. If it takes lightning damage, this ability doesn't function at the start of its next turn.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>7 &#8212; Sturdy Frame. The clockwork's hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to its number of Hit Dice.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>8 &#8212; Suction. The clockwork gains a climbing speed of 30 feet.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>9 &#8212; Vocal Resonator. The clockwork gains the ability to speak rudimentary Common or Gnomish (creator's choice).</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>10 &#8212; Water Propulsion. The clockwork gains a swimming speed of 30 feet.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>Clockwork Malfunctions:</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>d10 &#8212; Malfunction</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>1 &#8212; Faulty Sensors. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is blinded until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>2 &#8212; Flawed Targeting. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork makes attack rolls with disadvantage until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>3 &#8212; Ground Fault. The clockwork has vulnerability to lightning damage.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>4 &#8212; Imprinting Loop. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork mistakes one creature it can see within 30 feet for its creator. The clockwork won't willingly harm that creature for 1 minute or until that creature attacks it or deals damage to it.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>5 &#8212; Leaking Lubricant. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork gains 1 level of exhaustion that it isn't immune to.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>6 &#8212; Limited Steering. The clockwork must move in a straight line. It can turn up to 90 degrees before moving and again at the midpoint of its movement. It can rotate freely if it doesn't use any of its speeds on its turn.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>7 &#8212; Overactive Sense of Self-Preservation. If the clockwork has half its hit points or fewer at the start of its turn in combat, roll a d6. If you roll a 1, it retreats from combat. If retreat isn't possible, it continues fighting.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>8 &#8212; Overheats. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is incapacitated until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>9 &#8212; Rusty Gears. The clockwork has disadvantage on initiative rolls, and its speed decreases by 10 feet.</text>
			<text>	 </text>
			<text>10 &#8212; Weak Armor. The clockwork isn't immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren't adamantine.</text>

			<name>Petrifying Touch</name>
			<text>The giant touches one Medium or smaller creature within 10 feet of it that is charmed by it. The target must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes petrified, and the giant can adhere the target to its stony body. Greater restoration spells and other magic that can undo petrification have no effect on a petrified creature on the giant unless the giant is dead, in which case the magic works normally, freeing the petrified creature as well as ending the petrified condition on it.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>Petrified:</text>
			<text>&#8226; A petrified creature is transformed, along with any nonmagical object it is wearing or carrying, into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone). Its weight increases by a factor of ten, and it ceases aging.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>&#8226; The creature is incapacitated (meaning it can't take actions or reactions), can't move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>&#8226; Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>&#8226; The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>&#8226; The creature has resistance to all damage.</text>

The target isn't under Strahd's control, but it takes Strahd's requests and actions in the most favorable way and lets Strahd bite it.</text>

			<text>	If the zombie is reduced to 0 hit points, all parts of it die. Until then, a severed part acts on the zombie's initiative and has its own action and movement. A severed part has AC 8. Any damage it takes is subtracted from the zombie's hit points.</text>

At the start of each of the target&#8217;s turns, the target takes 1d6 piercing damage per rot grub infesting it. Applying fire to the bite wound before the end of the target's next turn deals 1 fire damage to the target and kills these rot grubs. After this time, these rot grubs are too far under the skin to be burned. If a target infested by rot grubs ends its turn with 0 hit points, it dies as the rot grubs burrow into its heart and kill it. Any effect that cures disease kills all rot grubs infesting the target.</text>

			<text>If the vampire isn't in sun light or running water, it can use its action to polymorph into a Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into its true form.</text>
			<text>	While in bat form, the vampire can't speak, its walking speed is 5 feet, and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies.</text>
			<text>	While in mist form, the vampire can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can't pass through water.

			<name>Possession (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)</name>
			<text>The yakfolk attempts to magically possess a humanoid or giant. The yakfolk must touch the target throughout a short rest, or the attempt fails.

Until the possession ends, the target is incapacitated, loses control of its body, and is unaware of its surroundings. The yakfolk now controls the body and can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, and it retains its alignment; its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; and its proficiencies. It otherwise uses the target's statistics, except the target's knowledge, class features, feats, and proficiencies. </text>
			<text>	The possession lasts until either the body drops to O hit points, the yakfolk ends the possession as an action, or the yakfolk is forced out of the body by an effect such as the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, the yakfolk reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body and is stunned until the end of its next turn.

			<name>Keen Hearing and Smell</name>
			<text>The yeth hound has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Sunlight Banishment</name>
			<text>If the yeth hound starts its turn in sunlight, it is transported to the Ethereal Plane. While sunlight shines on the spot from which it vanished, the hound must remain in the Deep Ethereal. After sunset, it returns to the Border Ethereal at the same spot, whereupon it typically sets out to find its pack or its master. The hound is visible on the Material Plane while it is in the Border Ethereal, and vice versa, but it can&#8217;t affect or be affected by anything on the other plane. Once it is adjacent to its master or a pack mate that is on the Material Plane, a yeth hound in the Border Ethereal can return to the Material Plane as an action.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Telepathic Bond</name>
			<text>While the yeth hound is on the same plane of existence as its master, it can magically convey what it senses to its master, and the two can communicate telepathically with each other.</text>

			<attack>Frightened Target|6|2d6+4+4d6</attack>
		</action>
		<action>
			<name>Baleful Baying</name>
			<text>The yeth hound bays magically. Every enemy within 300 feet of the hound that can hear it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of the hound&#8217;s next turn or until the hound is incapacitated. A frightened target that starts its turn within 30 feet of the hound must use all its movement on that turn to get as far from the hound as possible, must finish the move before taking an action, and must take the most direct route, even if hazards lie that way. A target that successfully saves is immune to the baying of all yeth hounds for the next 24 hours.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>Frightened:</text>
			<text>&#8226; A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>&#8226; The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.</text>

		<action>
			<name>Chilling Gaze</name>
			<text>The yeti targets one creature it can see within 30 ft. of it. If the target can see the yeti, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw against this magic or take 10 (3d6) cold damage and then be paralyzed for 1 minute, unless it is immune to cold damage. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the target's saving throw is successful, or if the effect ends on it, the target is immune to the Chilling Gaze of all yetis (but not abominable yetis) for 1 hour.</text>
			<text>	</text>

			<text>As a bonus action after moving at least 10 feet on the ground, the zaratan can send a shock wave through the ground in a 120-foot-radius circle centered on itself. That area becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute. Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw or the creature's concentration is broken.</text>
			<text>	The shock wave deals 100 thunder damage to all structures in contact with the ground in the area. If a creature is near a structure that collapses, the creature might be buried; a creature within half the distance of the structure's height must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 17 (5d6) bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is trapped in the rubble. A trapped creature is restrained, requiring a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. Another creature within 5 feet of the buried creature can use its action to clear rubble and grant advantage on the check. If three creatures use their actions in this way, the check is an automatic success. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn't fall prone or become trapped.</text>
			<text>	</text>
			<text>Prone:</text>
			<text>&#8226; A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.</text>

			<text>&#8226; An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.</text>

Any flesh-and-blood creature in the cloud when it appears, or that enters it later, must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature can't be infected by these spores for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature is infected with a disease called the spores of Zuggtmoy and also gains a random form of madness (determined by rolling on the Madness of Zuggtmoy table) that lasts until the creature is cured of the disease or dies. While infected in this way, the creature can't be reinfected, and it must repeat the saving throw at the end of every 24 hours, ending the infection on a success. On a failure, the infected creature's body is slowly taken over by fungal growth, and after three such failed saves, the creature dies and is reanimated as a spore servant if it's a type of creature that can be (see the "Myconids" entry in the Monster Manual).</text>
