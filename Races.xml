		<name>Shifting Seasons</name>
		<text>Eladrin are elves native to the Feywild, a realm of beauty, unpredictable emotion, and boundless magic. An eladrin is associated with one of the four seasons and has coloration reminiscent of that season, which can also affect the eladrin&#8217;s mood:</text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>Autumn is the season of peace and goodwill, when summer&#8217;s harvest is shared with all.</text>
		<text>Winter is the season of contemplation and dolor, when the vibrant energy of the world slumbers.</text>
		<text>Spring is the season of cheerfulness and celebration, marked by merriment as winter&#8217;s sorrow passes.</text>
		<text>Summer is the season of boldness and aggression, a time of unfettered energy.</text>
		<text>	 </text>
		<text>	Some eladrin remain associated with a particular season for their entire lives, whereas other eladrin transform, adopting characteristics of a new season. When finishing a long rest, any eladrin can change their season. An eladrin might choose the season that is present in the world or perhaps the season that most closely matches the eladrin&#8217;s current emotional state. For example, an eladrin might shift to autumn if filled with contentment, another eladrin could change to winter if plunged into sorrow, still another might be bursting with joy and become an eladrin of spring, and fury might cause an eladrin to change to summer.</text>

		<name>Claws</name>

	<trait>
		<name>Natural Armor</name>
		<text>Due to your shell and the shape of your body, you are ill-suited to wearing armor. Your shell provides ample protection, however; it gives you a base AC of 17 (your Dexterity modifier doesn&#8217;t affect this number). You gain no benefit from wearing armor, but if you are using a shield, you can apply the shield&#8217;s bonus as normal.</text>

	<trait>
		<name>Shell Defense</name>
		<text>You can withdraw into your shell as an action. Until you emerge, you gain a +4 bonus to AC, and you have advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws. While in your shell, you are prone, your speed is 0 and can&#8217;t increase, you have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, you can&#8217;t take reactions, and the only action you can take is a bonus action to emerge from your shell.</text>

		<name>Trance</name>
		<text>Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is "trance.") While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</text>
