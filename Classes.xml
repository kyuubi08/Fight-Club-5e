				<name>Primal Path: Path of the Ancestral Guardian</name>
				<text>Some barbarians hail from cultures that revere their ancestors. These tribes teach that the warriors of the past linger on in the world as mighty spirits, who can guide and protect the living. When barbarians who follow this path rage, they cross the barrier into the spirit world and call on these guardian spirits for aid.</text>
				<text>	Barbarians who draw on their ancestral guardians fight to protect their tribes and their allies. With the spirits&#8217; help, they can hinder their foes even as they strike powerful blows against them. In order to cement ties to their ancestral guardians, barbarians who follow this path cover themselves in elaborate tattoos that celebrate their ancestors&#8217; deeds. These tattoos tell epic sagas of victories against terrible monsters and other fearsome rivals.</text>

Until the start of your next turn, that target has disadvantage on any attack roll that isn&#8217;t against you, and when the target hits a creature other than you with an attack, that creature has resistance to the damage dealt by the attack. The ffect on the target ends early if your rage ends.</text>

				<name>Primal Path: Path of the Berserker</name>
				<text>For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end &#8212; that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker&#8217;s rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.</text>

				<name>Frenzy (Path of the Berserker)</name>
				<text>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion.</text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Exhaustion:</text>
				<text>	Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.</text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Level &#8212; Effect:</text>
				<text>1 &#8212;Disadvantage on ability checks</text>
				<text>2 &#8212;Speed halved</text>

				<text>5 &#8212;Speed reduced to 0</text>
				<text>6 &#8212;Death</text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>	If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.</text>
				<text>	A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.</text>
				<text>	An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.</text>
				<text>	Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.</text>

				<name>Primal Path: Path of the Storm Herald</name>
				<text>All barbarians harbor a fury within. Their rage grants them superior strength, durability, and speed. Barbarians who follow the Path of the Storm Herald learn to transform their rage into a mantle of primal magic, which swirls around them. When in a fury, a barbarian of this path taps into the forces of nature to create powerful magical effects.</text>
				<text>	Storm heralds are typically elite champions who train alongside druids, rangers, and others sworn to protect nature. Other storm heralds hone their craft in elite lodges in regions wracked by storms, in the frozen reaches at the world&#8217;s end, or deep in the hottest deserts.</text>

				<text>Starting at 3rd level, you emanate a stormy magical aura while you rage. The aura extends 10 feet from you in every direction, but not through total cover.</text>

				<text>Sea: When this effect is activated, you can choose one other creature you can see in your aura. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw.

In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>

				<text>	The bards of this college are regarded with a mixture of awe and fear. Their performances are the stuff of legend. The bards of this college are so eloquent that a speech or song that one of them performs can cause captors to release the bard unharmed and can lull a furious dragon into complacency. The same magic that allows them to quell beasts can also bend minds. Villainous bards of this college can leech off a community for weeks, abusing their magic to turn their hosts into thralls. Heroic bards of this college instead use this power to gladden the downtrodden and undermine oppressors.</text>

				<name>Mantle of Inspiration (College of Glamour)</name>
				<text>When you join the College of Glamour at 3rd level, you gain the ability to weave a song of fey magic that imbues your allies with vigor and speed. </text>
				<text>	As a bonus action, you can expend a use of Bardic Inspiration to grant yourself a wondrous appearance. When you do so, choose a number of allies you can see and who can see you within 60 feet of you, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Each of them gains 5 temporary hit points. When a creature gains these temporary hit points, it can immediately use its reaction to move up to its speed, without provoking opportunity attacks.</text>
				<text>	The number of temporary hit points increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 8 at 5th level, 11 at 10th level, and 14 at 15th level.</text>

				<text>Starting at 3rd level, you can charge your performance with seductive, fey magic. </text>

At the end of the performance, choose a number of humanoids within 60 feet of you who watched and listened to all of it, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be charmed by you. While charmed in this way, the target idolizes you, it speaks glowingly of you to anyone who talks to it, and it hinders anyone who opposes you, although it avoids violence unless it was already inclined to fight on your behalf. This effect ends on a target after 1 hour, if it takes any damage, if you attack it, or if it witnesses you attacking or damaging any of its allies. </text>
				<text>	If a target succeeds on its save against this effect, the target has no hint that you tried to charm it. </text>

				<name>Bard College: College of Lore</name>
				<text>Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.</text>
				<text>	The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic.</text>
				<text>	The college&#8217;s members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.</text>

				<name>Bard College: College of Swords</name>
				<text>Bards of the College of Swords are called blades, and they entertain through daring feats of weapon prowess. Blades perform stunts such as sword swallowing, knife throwing and juggling, and mock combats. But though they use their weapons to entertain, they are also highly trained and skilled warriors in their own right.</text>
				<text>	Their talent with weapons inspires many blades to lead double lives. One blade might use a circus troupe as cover for nefarious deeds such as assassination, robbery, and blackmail. Other blades strike at the wicked, bringing justice to bear against the cruel and powerful. Most troupes are happy to accept a blade&#8217;s talent for the excitement it adds to a performance, but few entertainers fully trust a blade in their ranks.</text>
				<text>	Blades who abandon lives as entertainers have often run into trouble that makes maintaining their secret activities impossible. A blade caught stealing or engaging in vigilante justice is too great a liability for most troupes. With their weapon skills and magic, these blades either take up work as enforcers for thieves&#8217; guilds or strike out on their own as adventurers.</text>

				<name>Spellcasting</name>
				<text>As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the cleric spell list.</text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Cantrips:</text>
				<text>	At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn an additional cleric cantrip of your choice at 4th level and another at 10th level. </text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Preparing and Casting Spells:</text>
				<text>	The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&#8217;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
				<text>	You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
				<text>	For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn&#8217;t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</text>
				<text>	You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. </text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Spellcasting Ability:</text>
				<text>	Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
				<text>	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</text>
				<text>	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier </text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Ritual Casting:</text>
				<text>	You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. </text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Spellcasting Focus:</text>
				<text>	You can use a holy symbol (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.</text>

				<text>Magic is an energy that suffuses the multiverse and that fuels both destruction and creation. Gods of the Arcana domain know the secrets and potential of magic intimately. For some of these gods, magical knowledge is a great responsibility that comes with a special understanding of the nature of reality. Other gods of Arcana see magic as pure power, to be used as its wielder sees fit.</text>
				<text>	The gods of this domain are often associated with knowledge, as learning and arcane power tend to go hand-in-hand. In the Realms, deities of this domain include Azuth and Mystra, as well as Corellon Larethian of the elven pantheon. In other worlds, this domain includes Hecate, Math Mathonwy, and Isis; the triple moon gods of Solinari, Lunitari, and Nuitari of Krynn; and Boccob, Vecna, and Wee Jas of Greyhawk.</text>

The gods of the forge teach that, with patience and hard work, even the most intractable metal can transform from a lump of ore to a beautifully wrought object. Clerics of these deities quest to search for objects lost to the forces of darkness, liberate mines overrun by orcs, and uncover rare and wondrous materials necessary to create potent magic items. Followers of these gods take great pride in their work, and they are willing to craft and use heavy armor and powerful weapons to protect them.

To desecrate the peace of the dead is an abomination. Deities of the grave include Kelemvor, Wee Jas, the ancestral spirits of the Undying Court, Hades, Anubis, and Osiris. Followers of these deities seek to put wandering spirits to rest, destroy the undead, and ease the suffering of the dying. Their magic also allows them to stave off death for a time, particularly for a person who still has some great work to accomplish in the world. This is a delay of death, not a denial of it, for death will eventually get its due.</text>

				<name>Spellcasting</name>
				<text>Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the druid spell list. </text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Cantrips:</text>
				<text>	At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn an additional druid cantrip of your choice at 4th level and another at 10th level. </text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Preparing and Casting Spells:</text>
				<text>	The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&#8217;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
				<text>	You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
				<text>	For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn&#8217;t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</text>
				<text>	You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. </text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Spellcasting Ability:</text>
				<text>	Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
				<text>	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</text>
				<text>	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier </text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Ritual Casting:</text>
				<text>	You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. </text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Spellcasting Focus:</text>
				<text>	You can use a druidic focus (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.</text>

				<name>Wild Shape</name>
				<text>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</text>
				<text>	Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table (Player&#8217;s Handbook, p. 66).</text>
				<text>	At 2nd level, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn&#8217;t have a flying or swimming speed. At 4th level, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/2 or lower that doesn&#8217;t have a flying speed. At 8th level, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1 or lower.</text>
				<text>	You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</text>
				<text>	While you are transformed, the following rules apply.</text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>&#8226; Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature&#8217;s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can&#8217;t use them.</text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>&#8226; When you transform, you assume the beast&#8217;s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn&#8217;t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren&#8217;t knocked unconscious.</text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>&#8226; You can&#8217;t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn&#8217;t break your concentration on a spell you&#8217;ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you&#8217;ve already cast.</text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>&#8226; You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can&#8217;t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>&#8226; You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature&#8217;s shape and size. Your equipment doesn&#8217;t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can&#8217;t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form. </text>

The druids&#8217; guardianship of the natural world makes for a natural alliance between them and good-aligned fey. These druids seek to fill the world with dreamy wonder. Their magic mends wounds and brings joy to downcast hearts, and the realms they protect are gleaming, fruitful places where dream and reality blend together and where the weary can find rest.</text>

				<name>Druid Circle: Circle of the Shepherd</name>
				<text>Druids of the Circle of the Shepherd commune with the spirits of nature, especially the spirits of beasts and the fey, and call to those spirits for aid. These druids recognize that all living things play a role in the natural world, yet they focus on protecting animals and fey creatures that have difficulty defending themselves. Shepherds, as they are known, see such creatures as their charges. They ward off monsters that threaten them, rebuke hunters who kill more prey than necessary, and prevent civilization from encroaching on rare animal habitats and on sites sacred to the fey. Many of these druids are happiest far from cities and towns, content to spend their days in the company of animals and the fey creatures of the wilds.</text>
				<text>	Members of this circle become adventurers to oppose forces that threaten their charges or to seek knowledge and power that will help them safeguard their charges better. Wherever these druids go, the spirits of the wilderness are with them.</text>

In addition, you and your allies have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks while in the aura.</text>

				<text>	A Purple Dragon Knight inspires greatness in others by committing brave deeds in battle. The mere presence of a knight in a hamlet is enough to cause some orcs and bandits to seek easier prey. A lone knight is a skilled warrior, but a knight leading a band of allies can transform even the most poorly equipped militia into a ferocious war band.</text>

Other monasteries are more like thieves&#8217; guilds, hiring out their services to nobles, rich merchants, or anyone else who can pay their fees.

				<text>When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you learn magical disciplines that harness the power of the four elements. A discipline requires you to spend ki points each time you use it.</text>
				<text>	You know the Elemental Attunement discipline and one other elemental discipline of your choice, which are detailed in the "Elemental Disciplines" section below. You learn one additional elemental discipline of your choice at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.</text>

				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Casting Elemental Spells. Some elemental disciplines allow you to cast spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting. To cast one of these spells, you use its casting time and other rules, but you don&#8217;t need to provide material components for it.</text>
				<text>	Once you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend additional ki points to increase the level of an elemental discipline spell that you cast, provided that the spell has an enhanced effect at a higher level, as burning hands does. The spell&#8217;s level increases by 1 for each additional ki point you spend. For example, if you are a 5th-level monk and use Sweeping Cinder Strike to cast burning hands, you can spend 3 ki points to cast it as a 2nd-level spell (the discipline&#8217;s base cost of 2 ki points plus 1).</text>
				<text>	The maximum number of ki points you can spend to cast a spell in this way (including its base ki point cost and any additional ki points you spend to increase its level) is determined by your monk level. At 5th level, you may spend up to 3 ki points; this increases to 4 ki points at 9th level, 5 at 13th level, and 6 at 17th level.</text>

				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Preparing and Casting Spells:</text>
				<text>	The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell&#8217;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
				<text>	You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier+half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
				<text>	For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn&#8217;t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</text>
				<text>	You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. </text>

				<text>	Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>

				<name>Sacred Oath: Oath of Conquest</name>
				<text>The Oath of Conquest calls to paladins who seek glory in battle and the subjugation of their enemies. It isn&#8217;t enough for these paladins to establish order. They must crush the forces of chaos. Sometimes called knight tyrants or iron mongers, those who swear this oath gather into grim orders that serve gods or philosophies of war and well-ordered might.</text>
				<text>	Some of these paladins go so far as to consort with the powers of the Nine Hells, valuing the rule of law over the balm of mercy. The archdevil Bel, warlord of Avernus, counts many of these paladins&#8212;called hell knights&#8212;as his most ardent supporters. Hell knights cover their armor with trophies taken from fallen enemies, a grim warning to any who dare oppose them and the decrees of their lords. These knights are often most fiercely resisted by other paladins of this oath, who believe that the hell knights have wandered too far into darkness.</text>

				<text>Tenets of Conquest: A paladin who takes this oath has the tenets of conquest seared on the upper arm.</text>
				<text>	 </text>

				<name>Sacred Oath: Oath of Devotion</name>
				<text>The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods&#8217; tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels &#8212; the perfect servants of good &#8212; as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms. </text>

				<name>Sacred Oath: Oath of Redemption</name>
				<text>The Oath of Redemption sets a paladin on a difficult path, one that requires a holy warrior to use violence only as a last resort. Paladins who dedicate themselves to this oath believe that any person can be redeemed and that the path of benevolence and justice is one that anyone can walk. These paladins face evil creatures in the hope of turning their foes to the light, and they slay their enemies only when such a deed will clearly save other lives. Paladins who follow this path are known as redeemers.</text>
				<text>	While redeemers are idealists, they are no fools. Redeemers know that undead, demons, devils, and other supernatural threats can be inherently evil. Against such foes, paladins who swear this oath bring the full wrath of their weapons and spells to bear. Yet the redeemers still pray that, one day, even creatures of wickedness will invite their own redemption.</text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Tenets of Redemption:</text>
				<text>	The tenets of the Oath of Redemption hold a paladin to a high standard of peace and justice.</text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Peace: Violence is a weapon of last resort. Diplomacy and understanding are the paths to long-lasting peace.</text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Innocence: All people begin life in an innocent state, and it is their environment or the influence of dark forces that drives them to evil. By setting the proper example, and working to heal the wounds of a deeply flawed world, you can set anyone on a righteous path.</text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Patience: Change takes time. Those who have walked the path of the wicked must be given reminders to keep them honest and true. Once you have planted the seed of righteousness in a creature, you must work day after day to allow it to survive and then flourish.</text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Wisdom: Your heart and mind must stay clear, for eventually you will be forced to admit defeat. While every creature can be redeemed, some are so far along the path of evil that you have no choice but to end their lives for the greater good. Any such action must be carefully weighed and the consequences fully understood, but once you have made the decision, follow through with it knowing your path is just.</text>

				<name>Sacred Oath: Oath of the Ancients</name>
				<text>The Oath of the Ancients is as old as the race of elves and the rituals of the druids. Sometimes called fey knights, green knights, or horned knights, paladins who swear this oath cast their lot with the side of the light in the cosmic struggle against darkness because they love the beautiful and life-giving things of the world, not necessarily because they believe in principles of honor, courage, and justice. They adorn their armor and clothing with images of growing things &#8212; leaves, antlers, or flowers &#8212; to reflect their commitment to preserving life and light in the world. </text>

				<text>Tenets of the Ancients:</text>

				<text>Kindle the Light: Through your acts of mercy, kindness, and forgiveness, kindle the light of hope in the world, beating back despair. </text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Shelter the Light: Where there is good, beauty, love, and laughter in the world, stand against the wickedness that would swallow it. Where life flourishes, stand against the forces that would render it barren. </text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Preserve Your Own Light: Delight in song and laughter, in beauty and art. If you allow the light to die in your own heart, you can&#8217;t preserve it in the world. </text>

The paladins who swear this oath dedicate themselves to serving society and, in particular, the laws that hold society together. These paladins are the watchful guardians on the walls, standing against the chaotic tides of barbarism that threaten to tear down all that civilization has built, and are commonly known as guardians, exemplars, or sentinels.

				<text>The Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to punish those who have committed a grievous sin. When evil forces slaughter helpless villagers, when an entire people turns against the will of the gods, when a thieves&#8217; guild grows too violent and powerful, when a dragon rampages through the countryside &#8212; at times like these, paladins arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set right that which has gone wrong.

				<name>Spellcasting</name>
				<text>By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger spell list. </text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Spell Slots:</text>
				<text>	The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&#8217;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
				<text>	For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot. </text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher:</text>
				<text>	You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.</text>
				<text>	You learn an additional ranger spell of your choice at each odd numbered level thereafter. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</text>
				<text>	Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. </text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Spellcasting Ability:</text>
				<text>	Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
				<text>	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</text>
				<text>	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</text>

Add your proficiency bonus to the beast&#8217;s AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in. Its hit point maximum equals the hit point number in its stat block or four times your ranger level, whichever is higher. Like any creature, it can spend Hit Dice during a short rest to regain hit points.</text>
				<text>	The beast obeys your commands as best as it can. It takes its turn on your initiative, though it doesn&#8217;t take an action unless you command it to. On your turn, you can verbally command the beast where to move (no action required by you). You can use your action to verbally command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Help action. Once you have the Extra Attack feature, you can make one weapon attack yourself when you command the beast to take the Attack action.</text>
				<text>	If you are incapacitated or absent, the beast acts on its own, focusing on protecting you and itself. The beast never requires your command to use its reaction, such as when making an opportunity attack.</text>
				<text>	While traveling through your favored terrain with only the beast, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.</text>
				<text>	If the beast dies, you can obtain a new companion by spending 8 hours magically bonding with a beast that isn&#8217;t hostile to you and that meets the requirements.</text>

				<name>Spellcasting</name>
				<text>An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic. This font of magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the sorcerer spell list. </text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Cantrips:</text>
				<text>	At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn an additional sorcerer cantrip of your choice at 4th level and another at 10th level. </text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Spell Slots:</text>
				<text>	The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&#8217;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
				<text>	For example, if you know the 1st-level spell burning hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast burning hands using either slot. </text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher:</text>
				<text>	You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.</text>
				<text>	You learn an additional sorcerer spell of your choice at each level except 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, 19th, and 20th. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</text>
				<text>	Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Spellcasting Ability:</text>
				<text>	Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
				<text>	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</text>
				<text>	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</text>

				<name>Sorcerous Origin: Divine Soul</name>
				<text>Sometimes the spark of magic that fuels a sorcerer comes from a divine source that glimmers within the soul. Having such a blessed soul is a sign that your innate magic might come from a distant but powerful familial connection to a divine being. Perhaps your ancestor was an angel, transformed into a mortal and sent to fight in a god&#8217;s name. Or your birth might align with an ancient prophecy, marking you as a servant of the gods or a chosen vessel of divine magic.</text>
				<text>	A Divine Soul, with a natural magnetism, is seen as a threat ny some religious hierarchies. As an outsider who commands sacred power, a Divine Soul can undermine an existing order by claiming a direct tie to the divine.</text>
				<text>	In some cultures, only those who can claim the power of a Divine Soul may command religious power. In these lands, ecclesiastical positions are dominated by a few bloodlines and preserved over generations.</text>

				<name>Spellcasting</name>
				<text>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list. </text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Cantrips:</text>
				<text>	At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn an additional wizard cantrip of your choice at 4th level, and another at 10th level.</text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Spellbook:</text>
				<text>	At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. </text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Preparing and Casting Spells:</text>
				<text>	The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&#8217;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
				<text>	You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so. choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
				<text>	For example, if you&#8217;re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn&#8217;t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</text>
				<text>	You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. </text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Spellcasting Ability:</text>
				<text>	Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
				<text>	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</text>
				<text>	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your intelligence modifier </text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Ritual Casting:</text>
				<text>	You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don&#8217;t need to have the spell prepared. </text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Spellcasting Focus:</text>
				<text>	You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells. </text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher:</text>
				<text>	Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook.</text>
				<text>	</text>
				<text>Source: Player's Handbook, p. 114</text>
			</feature>
		</autolevel>
		<autolevel level="1">
			<feature>
				<name>Spellbook</name>
				<text>The spells of 1st level and higher that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard&#8217;s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Copying a Spell into the Book:</text>
				<text>	When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</text>
				<text>	Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</text>
				<text>	For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Replacing the Book:</text>
				<text>	You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book &#8212; for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</text>
				<text>	If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>The Book&#8217;s Appearance:</text>
				<text>	Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</text>

				<name>Arcane Tradition: War Magic</name>
				<text>A variety of arcane colleges specialize in training wizards for war. The tradition of War Magic blends principles of evocation and abjuration, rather than specializing in either of those schools. It teaches techniques that empower a caster&#8217;s spells, while also providing methods for a wizard to bolster their own defenses.</text>
				<text>	Followers of this tradition are known as war mages. They see their magic as both a weapon and armor, a resource superior to any flimsy piece of steel. War mages act fast in battle, using their spells to seize tactical control of a situation. Their spells strike hard, while their defensive skills foil their opponents&#8217; attempts to counterattack. War mages are also adept at turning other spellcasters&#8217; magical energy against them.</text>
				<text>	In great battles, a war mage often works with evokers, abjurers, and other types of wizards. Evokers, in particular, sometimes tease war mages for splitting their attention between offense and defense. A war mage&#8217;s typical response: "What good is being able to throw a mighty fireball if I die before I can cast it?"</text>

When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to interpose the illusory duplicate between the attacker and yourself. The attack automatically misses you, then the illusion dissipates.</text>
